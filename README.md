## üí° Inspiration

One day, while browsing through Reddit, I came across a post in the u/Borrow community. It caught my attention. An individual needed $75 to purchase school textbooks and offered to repay $100. The concept of borrowing and lending money among strangers on a social media platform intrigued me greatly. This Reddit community sparked the inspiration for my project, Cash +.

Cash+ addresses the need for financial inclusivity, empowers entrepreneurs, supports education, fosters community support, and amplifies social impact. By embracing microfinancing, we can uplift individuals and communities, create opportunities, and contribute to a more equitable and prosperous society.

## üíª What it does

Cash+ is a microfinancing app that aims to empower individuals by providing a platform for borrowing and lending small amounts of money. It connects borrowers in need of financial assistance with lenders who are willing to offer support. The app facilitates transactions, ensures transparency, and promotes a sense of community by fostering connections between borrowers and lenders.

Cash+ goes beyond traditional banking systems to address the financial needs of underserved individuals and communities. It enables users to access funds for various purposes, such as education, entrepreneurship, personal emergencies, and more. The app emphasizes financial inclusion, allowing users who may have limited access to traditional banking services to obtain microloans.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I built it

- Figma: For UI/UX development
- Swift: For front-end development

## Challenges I ran into
Participating in a 2-day hackathon and learning Swift simultaneously, a programming language unfamiliar to me was definitely challenging. The limited time frame and the complexity of the language posed significant hurdles. However, I am immensely proud of how it all turned out.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learning Swift within such a tight deadline demanded an intense and focused effort. Navigating through documentation, online tutorials, and seeking help from experienced developers, I pushed myself to grasp the fundamentals and syntax of the language.
